# Augmented Reality Goalkeeper Game

Welcome to the Augmented Reality Goalkeeper Game! This is a simple two-player game where one player acts as a goalkeeper and the other player tries to score a goal. The game is designed to be played using augmented reality technology and requires two players to control their respective characters using specific controls.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is for the goal-scoring player to shoot the ball past the goalkeeper player and score as many goals as possible within a given time limit. The goalkeeper player's task is to block the shots and prevent the ball from entering the goal.
